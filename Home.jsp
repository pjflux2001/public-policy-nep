pedagogical and curricular restructuring of 5+3+3+4 covering ages 3-18 as shown in the
representative figure </li></p>
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">The curricular and pedagogical structure and the curricular framework for school education will
therefore be guided by a 5+3+3+4 design, consisting of the Foundational Stage (in two parts, that is,
3 years of Anganwadi/pre-school + 2 years in primary school in Grades 1-2; both together covering
ages 3-8), Preparatory Stage (Grades 3-5, covering ages 8-11), Middle Stage (Grades 6-8, covering
ages 11-14), and Secondary Stage (Grades 9-12 in two phases, i.e., 9 and 10 in the first and 11 and
12 in the second, covering ages 14-18).</li> </ul></p>

            <div class="content">
               <p><ul> <li style="text-align:justify">The NEP identifies that over 85 percent of a child's brain develops by the age of 6 and emphasizes
on providing critical importance to appropriate care and stimulation of the brain in a child’s early years for healthy brain development and growth.
It states that it is, therefore of the utmost importance that every child has access to quality early childhood care and education (ECCE).</li></p>
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">The overall aim of Early childhood care and education (ECCE) will be to attain optimal outcomes in the domains of physical and motor development, cognitive development, socio-emotional-ethical development, cultural/artistic development, and the development of communication and early language, literacy, and numeracy.</li></p>
<p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="img_src\ecce1.jpg"></p>
            </div>
<p><li style="text-align:justify">On completion of education up to the age of 5 in Anganwadi, every child shall move to a "Preparatory Class" (that is, before Class 1) in the primary school which has an ECE qualified teacher, deployed by rationalising existing human resources, or specially appointed for this purpose.</li></p>
<p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="img_src\ecce2.jpg"></p>
            </div>	
            <p><li style="text-align:justify">Ages 3 to 8 Years will cover 3 years of early education comprising Nursery, LKG & UKG along with 2 years of classes I & II. The NEP 2020 formally inducts early childhood care and education (ECCE) into the Indian education system with a recommended informal, flexible, multilevel, play/activity-based instructional approach that focusses on domain-based learning outcomes, informal assessments through observations, inculcation of healthy habits for life and positive socialization of the young learners with their peers.</li> </ul></p>

<br><br><br> <button type="button" class="sec1"><i class="fas fa-school"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Preparatory Stage (Age 9-11)</b></button>
            <div class="content">
               <p><ul> <li style="text-align:justify"> Preparatory Years aged 9-11 will cover classes III, IV & V. NEP2020 prescribes a more formal yet interactive classroom teaching in the preparatory years with play, discovery and activity-based pedagogy. A structured subject-wise curriculum will lay down strong academic foundations at this level through teaching of languages, science, and mathematics and holistic development through inclusion of art and physical education etc.</li></p>
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">This staggered learning plan that has divided the erstwhile primary years into two different stages, envisages a greater and more independent engagement of learners in the learning process in classes III-V through discovery approach of learning which basically involves ‘learning by doing’ through exploration of environment and manipulation of objects and materials to learn by problem solving.</li></ul></p>
            </div>
<br><br><br> <button type="button" class="sec1"><i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Middle Stage (Age 12-14)</b></button>
            <div class="content">
               <p><ul> <li style="text-align:justify"> Middle Years aged 12-14 will cover classes VI to VIII. In this phase of schooling NEP2020 talks of specialized faculty, meaning subject-wise teachers for learning abstract concepts in sciences, mathematics, social sciences. NEP recommends a hands-on experiential learning approach for conceptual understanding, also encouraging learners to explore topics across disciplines for holistic understanding (inter-disciplinary approach).</li></p>
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">Eclipsed by the hype of board-exams for classes IX and X, the middle years have always been the most neglected stage of school education. The NEP highlights this stage by envisaging greater academic complexities in the middle school curriculum through introduction of abstract concepts in all subjects to lay down strong academic foundations for the next and final stage of schooling.</li></p>
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">Experiential learning is essentially 'learning by doing' to build conceptual understanding and skills. This process involves guided practice, reflection, observation, evaluation. It accelerates learning, improves retention because it amalgamates all domains of learning - cognitive, psychomotor and affective in the learning process. Adoption of an integrated and inter-disciplinary approach of learning will ensure more meaningful, holistic and cohesive learning experience for the students.</li></p>

<br><br><br> <button type="button" class="sec1"><i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Secondary Stage (Age 15-18)</b></button>
            <div class="content">
               <p><ul> <li style="text-align:justify"> Secondary Stage aged 15-18 will cover classes IX to XII in two phases, IX and X in the first phase and XI and XII in the second phase. This is the most significant academic restructuring that prioritizes learners’ life aspirations by giving them greater flexibility and choice of subjects in deciding their career preferences at the secondary stage.</li></p>
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">The NEP2020 talks of dissolving the silos of science, commerce and humanities streams on one hand and academic and vocational streams on the other, by offering wider and more flexible subject combinations to the learners.</li></p>
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">The NEP describes this stage as four years of multidisciplinary study, which means that if you wish to learn chemistry with geography, physics with economics, biology with history or mathematics with music you will be able to make such choices.</li></p> 
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">The 10+2 stage is currently characterized by stress and anxiety due to the pressure of Board exams being the gate-way for college admissions. The NEP 2020 hopes to mitigate this by providing a wider range of subjects at the Secondary level with flexible permutations and combinations for students to choose as per their interests, choices and career aspirations.</li></p>
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">NEPs strong thrust on vocational education, is aimed at skilling Indian students for the job-opportunities in 21 st century work space. NEP 2020 hopes to give learners opportunities to build their repertoire of skills through industry-integrated, innovative vocational courses and entrepreneurial skills. For preparing their learners to work in the VUCA world, the schools could additionally develop in them 4Cs of 21 st century skills -Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration and Creativity.</li></p>
   <p><li style="text-align:justify">NEP allows students to take a sabbatical at the end of class X for exploring their choice of careers probably through apprenticeships/ internships and later rejoin school at class XI. The induction of older students rejoining the school after a gap year or two would alter the learning environment of these classes to more open, flexible, hybrid and professional models to learning.</li></ul></p>
            </div>
<br><br><br> <button type="button" class="sec1"><i class="fas fa-exchange-alt"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Other changes</b></button>
            <div class="content">
               <p><ul> <li style="text-align:justify"> As per the new policy, by 2030, the minimum degree required for teaching will be a four-year integrated BEd. Apart from this, the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) will also be changed as per the new school system.</li></p>
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">Earlier, the TET was divided into two components - part 1 and part 2. Now that the school structure has been divided into four parts - foundational, preparatory, middle, and secondary - TET will also be developed accordingly. For subject teachers, suitable TET or the National Testing Agency (NTA) test scores in the corresponding subjects will also be taken into account for recruitment. The NTA will hold exams for all subjects and a common aptitude test.</li></p>
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">Those who qualify TET will have to give a demonstration or appear in an interview, and show their knowledge of the local language, as per the new policy. As per the NEP, "Interview will become an integral part of teacher hiring". These interviews would also assess comfort and proficiency in teaching in the local language. It would be a must for teachers in private schools as well to qualify TET.</li></p> 
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">Since schools will need teachers who can teach in multiple languages and have knowledge of new-age courses like computational thinking, coding etc., introduced at the school level under the NEP, BEd course will also be changed accordingly. The BEd courses will be of four-year duration. Dual BEd degrees with a focus on one language and having bilingual lectures will be offered too. BEd programmes will allow specialisation in the education of 'gifted children'.</li></p>
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">To ensure that outstanding students enter the teaching profession - especially from rural areas - a large number of merit-based scholarships shall be instituted across the country for studying quality 4-year integrated BEd programs. In rural areas, special merit-based scholarships will be established that also include preferential employment in their local areas upon successful completion of their BEd programmes.Such scholarships will provide local job opportunities to local students, especially female students so that these students serve as local-area role models and as highly qualified teachers who speak the local language. Incentives will be provided for teachers to take up teaching jobs in rural areas.</li></p>
  <p><li style="text-align:justify">The merit-based structure of tenure, promotion, and salary structure will be developed. Under this model, teachers will be incentivised. The system of assessment will consist of multiple parameters. These parameters will be developed by each state and will include peer reviews, attendance, commitment, hours of CPD, and other forms of service to the school and the community.</li></p>
   <p><li style="text-align:justify">A common guiding set of National Professional Standards for Teachers (NPST) will be developed by 2022, by the National Council for Teacher Education. The professional standards will be reviewed every 10 years.Teacher transfers will be halted, as per NEP 2020. Transfers will be allowed in "very special circumstances". Furthermore, transfers will be conducted through an online computerized system that ensures transparency.</li></ul></p>
